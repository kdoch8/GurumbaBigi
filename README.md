Data Story

## Project story

Down through generations, the Aboriginal people's stories, were told orally, but were never written down.

Our Gurumba Bigi initiative is centred around cultural and educational exchanges to showcase and strengthen aboriginal languages from Queensland and Torres Strait Islands.
We launched into this project because approximately 90% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are endangered. By showcasing these languages, current and future generations might have the opportunity to learn from and connect to these diverse communities and their unique languages.

To facilitate this project, we combined multiple data sources. For instance, we extracted data from the State Library of Queensland via the data.qld.gov.au website. In this data we found words for anatomy, animals, and greetings.
We also collectected data from AUSTLANG database to get the location points of the selected languages. And used free images from Pixabay.

We are addressing two regional challenges
* How might we showcase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages?
* How might we use Queensland spatial information to find out where languages are from?

Our vision is to showcase a small number of aboriginal Queensland languages by providing easily accessible, engaging, and interactive resources. We created an interactive map where you can see the locations of the respective languages, you can pick an animal and learn the words for it, or you can follow along the song “head, shoulders, knees and toes” in an Indigenous language using the Body section of the website.

To implement the website we used multiple tools, such as Python, Flask, Javascript, CSS, R and PowerBI. It is currently hosted on PythonAnywhere.

Readmap: We would love to make it even more interactive, by adding additional languages and words. A full 3D model of a person with descriptive anatomy words shown in the model, as well as corresponding sound files for correct pronunciation.

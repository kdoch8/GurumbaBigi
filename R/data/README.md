# datasets

We collected multiple datasets for this project. For instance, we extracted data from the State Library of Queensland via the 
[data.qld.gov.au](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/slq-aboriginal-languages-word-lists/resource/5c0d6488-63f0-48db-afc4-610773e1ea82?inner_span=True) website (such as words for body parts, animals, and greetings).
We also collectected data from AIATSIS and [AUSTLANG](https://collection.aiatsis.gov.au/datasets/austlang/001) to get the location points of the selected languages in Queensland 
which helped us to map the information from the languages to spatial localities. 

The data in this folder has been aggregated from the open source datasets and are CC by 4.0 as the original sources.
